- 🔧 Soldered BMS and balancing wires to the battery pack
- 🔧 tested battery capacity (they cant reach 4.20, max 4.15)
- 🎨 made 3d model bracket for the power button

## 📅 May 13, 2025
- 📦 printed the power button bracket
- 🔧 Soldered and fitted the button on the robot

## 📅 May 14, 2025
- :page_facing_up: fixed prior log data
- 🔍 retested gyro
- 🔧 created gyro board and fited it to the robot

- :page_facing_up: to the user data file created on the tablet

## 📅 May 15, 2025
- :page_facing_up: created pinout for the project + future improvements
- 🔍 retested gyro on 3V (because the stm32f407 board can read with the ADC up to 3V)
- 🔧 fixed the gyro board to output 3V
- 🔧 created MCU board and fited it to the robot
    - used multitool for the first time
![MCU board](/media/MCU_board.jpeg "MCU board") 
- :page_facing_up: created doc file for the board shield on the tablet
- 🤖 robot hardware done

## 📅 May 20, 2025
- 💻 fixed the Franken bot file, now:
    - reads the gyroscope
    - reads the accelerometer
    - controls the motors
- 💻 added PID algorythim
- 🤖 baddly configured PID, but the robot is trying to stabilize itself
